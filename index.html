        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Ukachukwu Blest Ebubeze, a Passionate Software Engineering Student from Nigeria

            Welcome to my corner of the web!
            Iâ€™m currently studying Software Engineering, where Iâ€™m focused on building practical skills in web
            development,
            backend
            systems, and everything in between. I enjoy solving real-world problems with code, learning new
            technologies,
            and
            contributing to meaningful projects. Here, youâ€™ll find a mix of what Iâ€™m working on, what Iâ€™m learning, and
            some of the things that inspire me as I
            grow in
            tech.</p>
